    "Our project uses the dataset “Emissions by Unit and Fuel Type (Subparts C, D, AA)”, obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The dataset provides facility-level and unit-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from the reporting years 2011 through 2023, focusing on large stationary industrial sources that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO₂-equivalent (CO₂e) annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "All emissions are reported in metric tons of CO₂e, calculated using global warming potentials (GWPs) from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) to standardize the impact of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O across facilities and fuels."

    "The file we created, emissions_by_unit_and_fuel_type_c_d_aa.xlsb, contains four sheets that organize and describe greenhouse gas emissions data collected by the EPA. The UNIT_DATA sheet lists individual emission units within each facility (e.g., boilers, turbines, process heaters) and includes variables such as Facility ID, Facility Name, State, NAICS Code, Year, Unit Type, Reporting Method, Maximum Heat Input, and emissions for CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, Biogenic CO₂, and Total CO₂e, allowing comparison of emissions intensity across facilities and equipment types. The FUEL_DATA sheet links facility and unit emissions to the type of fuel used, with columns for Facility ID, Unit ID, Industry Type, General Fuel Type, Specific Fuel Type, Blend Fuel Name, Other Fuel Name, and CH₄ and N₂O emissions (mt CO₂e); most “blend fuel” and “other fuel” fields are empty, indicating that single-fuel systems dominate. The Industry Type sheet defines each reporting subpart (C, D, AA) and connects it to its industrial category—such as Stationary Fuel Combustion, Electricity Generation, or Pulp and Paper Manufacturing—helping distinguish between different emission sources. Finally, the FAQs about this Data sheet provides definitions for key variables (Facility ID, FRS ID, NAICS Code), explains how biogenic CO₂ is reported, lists the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) used in calculations, and includes official EPA links for verifying and exploring emissions data."

    "The dataset is largely complete and reliable, though a few areas show minor gaps that could influence the analysis. The Biogenic CO₂ and blend fuel columns are missing for most facilities, since many industrial sites do not use biomass or mixed-fuel systems. The Maximum Heat Input Capacity column is occasionally unreported, as it is optional for some facilities. In a few cases, facility identifiers have been withheld by the EPA as Confidential Business Information to protect proprietary data. It is also worth noting that the dataset only includes facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of CO₂-equivalent per year, so smaller emitters are not represented and the focus is on large industrial sources. Despite these limitations, the essential variables such as Facility ID, Reporting Year, Industry Type, and Total Emissions for CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O are over 99 percent complete. This makes the dataset highly dependable and provides a solid foundation for modeling greenhouse gas emissions and analyzing uncertainty."
